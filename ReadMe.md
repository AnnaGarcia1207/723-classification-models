# 723 Classification Project

This is a class project that explores different binary classification models namely, Logistic Regression,
Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, and a simple Neural Network. The project uses the Heart Disease dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). The project can be ran two ways: as a web application and locally.
The web application (appy.py) that runs locally, which allows the user to input their own data, while metrics.py allows user to visualize the metrics of the models.

## Required Software
1. Python 3.11. 
> Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/) - Use Windows installer
2. Git
> Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Visual Studio Code (optional)
> Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Setup
1. Ensure that you have python3 running in your machine. Specifically python3.9, 3.10, or 3.11
To check from command line:

```
python –-version
```
2. Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.
```
git –-version
```

3. Open your favorite commandline

4. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AnnaGarcia1207/723-classification-models.git
```

5. `cd` into the directory.
    * You can keep using teh commandline from here or use VisualStudioCode

6. From the directory, check the python version you are using: `python –-version`. If you are using the latest python version 3.12 and above we need to use the earlier version to download the required libraries in a python virtual environment.

7. Go back to the command line. From the directory, download python virtualenv
```
py -3.11 -m pip install virtualenv
```
8. Create a virtual environment, here I named it “venv”
```
py -3.11 -m virtualenv venv
```

9. You should see 'venv/' folder get created. We need to activate this virtual environment, so all of out libraries is contained within the `venv/` folder.
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

10. You should see `(venv)` in the commandline- meaning it was successfully activated.

11. Install packages:
	```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
	If this does not work please type:
    ```
    pip install tensorflow, pandas, scikit-learn, flask
    ```

## Running the program

Now that your environment is setup, you can explore the models two different ways. There is a Flask web application (appy.py) and a simple python script (metrics.py). 


### How to run Flask web application locally (app.py)

12. To run the web application locally : 
```
flask run
```
or 
```
python app.py
```
This will run in your localhost: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ – copy&paste in your browser. 
You should see an output:

![python app.py](readMeImages/webExample.PNG)

After hitting submit you should see result output below:

![python app.py submit](readMeImages/submitExample.PNG)


13. To close the program simple pres `Ctrl+c` and deactivate the `venv` virtual environment
```
deactivate
```

### How to run Metrics script locally (metrics.py)

12. To run `metrics.py` to get the baseline metrics of each models type:
```
python metrics.py
```

13. User will be prompted for input. User can input `0, 1, 2, 3, and Q`

The corresponding input is as follows:
```
0: Logistic Regression
1: K-nearest neighbor
2: Simple Neural Network
3: Naive Bayes
Q: Quit the program
```

14. A sample output if user input `0`:
![python metrics.py](readMeImages/metricsExample.PNG)

15. To quit press `Q` and deactivate the `venv` virtual environment.
```
deactivate
```
